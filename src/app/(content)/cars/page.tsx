          <p>
            I've loved cars for as long as I can remember: the looks, the style,
            the feel, the noise, everything about them. I've been lucky enough
            to have been able to have owned more cars than the average person; a
            collection of the good, the bad, the ugly, and the sketchy-as-hell.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page attempts to lay out all of the cars that have come and
            gone from my life. I should note that as of this writing, it does
            not include motorcycles, scooters, or similar motorized vehicles,
            and it does not list all of the cars that I've driven- <i>that</i>{" "}
            would be quite the list.
